Of course. Here is a quick README.md file for your n8n project that explains its objective and how to use it.

n8n AI-Powered Feedback Responder
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a simple and effective automation that instantly processes user feedback submitted through a web form. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to classify the user's comment, draft a personalized and professional response, and automatically email that reply back to the user. This ensures timely communication and enhances user engagement without manual intervention.

Workflow Description
This n8n workflow provides an end-to-end solution for handling customer feedback. The process is as follows:

Form Submission: The workflow is triggered when a user submits their Name, Email, and Comment via a public n8n Form Trigger.

AI Processing: The submitted comment is sent to a Google Gemini model. The AI classifies the comment as "Feedback," "Complaint," or "Suggestion" and drafts a complete email reply from the perspective of the company, "MysterioSocialConnector".

Automated Email Reply: The workflow takes the AI-generated draft and automatically sends it as an email to the user who filled out the form.

Features
Automated Form Handling: Generates a public form to capture user feedback.

AI-Powered Classification: Intelligently categorizes user comments.

Dynamic Email Drafting: Creates context-aware, professional email replies.

End-to-End Automation: No manual steps are required from submission to response.

Nodes Used
Form Trigger: To capture user input.

Google Gemini: For AI-based classification and text generation.

Send Email: To dispatch the automated reply.

Setup and Configuration
To use this workflow, follow these steps:

Import: Import the Smart Router.json file into your n8n instance.

Configure Credentials:

Google Gemini: Create a new credential using your Google Gemini API key and connect it to the "Message a model" node.

SMTP: Create a new credential with your SMTP provider's details (Host, Port, User, Password) and connect it to the "Send email" node.

CRITICAL - Update Email Node: The provided JSON has a misconfiguration. You must update the Send email node to use the AI's output:

Subject: Set this field with an expression to get the subject from the AI.

Text / HTML: Set this field with an expression to get the email_draft from the "Message a model" node. An example expression for the body would be: ={{ $('Message a model').item.json.json.email_draft }}

Activate: Save the workflow and toggle it to Active.

How to Use
Once the workflow is active:

Click on the "On form submission" node to get the Production URL.

Use this URL as the endpoint for your live website form, or share the link directly with users.

Any submission to this form will now trigger the automated AI response.
